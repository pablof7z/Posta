## Overview

Posta is a modern iOS messaging application built on the [Nostr protocol](https://nostr.com), designed to provide a **Telegram-like** user experience with decentralized, encrypted messaging capabilities. It bridges the gap between familiar messaging UX and the freedom of decentralized communication.

## Philosophy

We believe privacy and user sovereignty shouldn't come at the cost of user experience. Posta makes decentralized messaging accessible to everyone by combining the intuitive interface patterns of popular messaging apps with the security and censorship-resistance of Nostr.
